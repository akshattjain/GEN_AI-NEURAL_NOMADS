Drug Genesis: Generative AI for Drug Similarity
Project Overview
Drug Genesis is a generative AI-based machine learning project that focuses on creating new drug compounds with similar properties to existing ones. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to identify and generate potential drug molecules based on input data. The model is built using a generative neural network that takes in chemical structure data and outputs potential new compounds with similar properties.

This platform aims to assist researchers and medical professionals in discovering alternative drugs by understanding chemical similarities, which can lead to the development of new treatments.

Key Features:
Generative Model: Uses a machine learning model that generates similar chemical structures based on input data.
Data Analysis: Incorporates a large CSV dataset with drug-related data.
Medical Relevance: Provides insights into similar drug properties which can aid in medical research.
Machine Learning Model Details
The core model used in Drug Genesis is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), consisting of two components:

Generator: This model generates new drug-like structures from a latent space.
Discriminator: The discriminator evaluates whether the structures generated by the generator are realistic or synthetic, based on existing drug data.
Dataset
The dataset is a comprehensive CSV file containing various chemical properties of drug compounds. The model processes this data to create new synthetic drug-like structures with similar characteristics.

Model Architecture
Input: Chemical data from the CSV file is fed into the model.
Latent Space Representation: The generator learns the latent space of the drug data and uses this representation to create new molecules.
Output: The final output consists of new drugs with similar properties to the input compound.
Core Functions Explained
Below are the key functions in the machine learning model:

load_data(): This function loads the CSV dataset, parses the chemical properties of drugs, and prepares the data for training.
preprocess_data(): Cleans the raw data, handles missing values, and normalizes it for the model.
build_generator(): Creates the architecture for the generator, which uses a neural network to generate new drug structures.
build_discriminator(): Defines the discriminator architecture, which evaluates the realism of the generated structures.
train_model(): Implements the training loop where the generator and discriminator are trained in tandem. The discriminator learns to classify real vs. synthetic data, while the generator improves to generate realistic data.
evaluate_model(): Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores for both the real and generated drug structures.
save_model(): Saves the trained model so that it can be reused for inference without retraining.
Evaluation Metrics
During the training process, the following metrics are used:

Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly classified real and generated structures.
Precision: Evaluates how many of the generated structures are truly similar to real drugs.
Recall: Measures how well the model identifies all relevant drug-like structures.
F1 Score: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between both.
Web Development Work
The Drug Genesis project is complemented by a web-based interface developed using React. This interface allows users to input a drug compound and retrieve potential new drugs with similar properties generated by the model. The frontend includes:

Chemical Structure Visualization: Shows the molecular structure of the input and generated compounds.
Search Feature: Allows users to search for drugs based on their chemical properties.
Additionally, the backend (if implemented) could support functionalities like handling real-time drug structure generation requests via APIs.
